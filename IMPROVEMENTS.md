- Maintain a user session store in the backend to save previous messages of the user. Send only the latest AI message to the frontend instead of all messages. Similarly implement a messsages state in the frontend and append the new messages in that state. Only send the latest user message from the frontend when the user sends a message instead of all messages.
- User session is currently a local map and the key is hardcoded (to limit scope to POC). Instead track the user session id with cookies.
- Handle Errors gracefully in UI for status codes 5xx and 4xx
- API call "https://glama.ai/api/mcp/v1/instances" is currently not returning the token required for see connection. So, mocked a valid response in `lib/mocks/instances.json`
